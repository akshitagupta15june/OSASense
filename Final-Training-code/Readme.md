Prediction of the severity of obstructive sleep apnea by anthropometric features. 

 

We apply a modern machine learning method, the support vector machine and TensorFlow (open-source software library) to establish a predicting model for the severity of OSA. 

we establish a prediction model for Asians by taking body shape profiles and age into account via SVM. We hypothesize that the established predictors are accurate for OSA severity. To confirm this hypothesis, we collected two large patient databases from two independent sleep labs and designed a prediction model for the OSA severity based on body shape profiles. 

The dataset of Patients information was collected from two independent sleep centres at the Taipei Medical University Hospital (TMUH, Taipei, Taiwan) and Shuang-Ho Hospital (SHH, New Taipei City, Taiwan). 

The inclusion criteria for this study were patients referred for suspected sleep disordered breathing, ages between 20 and 80 

AHI: Apnea hypopnea index we have considered that if AHI is greater than 15 and less than 30 then the person has no sleep apnea but if the AHI is greater than 30 then the person is positive with sleep apnea. 

The model was confirmed with high prediction rates on two independently large databases. It was found to be particularly accurate in discriminating patients with AHI higher or lower than 30 in the Asian young female group. 

The TMUH database contains the following parameters:  

Age, sex, weight and height, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), BQ (Behavioural Quotient). Furthermore, the anthropometric features such as head, buttock, waist and neck circumferences were also measured in the sleep lab. 

The BQ is composed of three categories including snoring behaviour, waketime sleepiness or fatigue, and obesity and/or hypertension. Each of these categories is classified as severe or not severe. If two out of three categories are severe, then the patient is of high risk with BQ number 1; otherwise the patient is of low risk with BQ number 0.
