963+ million Number of Patients suffering from Sleep Apnea around the World. Indians are 33% suffering from Sleep Apnea Disorder.As per recent studies NIH and NetMeds India, Indian population is at the high risk of Obstructive Sleep Apnea due to the anatomy, Overweight and Hypertension.

</br>

#### Excessive sleepiness,severe snoring,choking while sleeping are the main symptoms of Sleep Apnea. Due to delayed diagnosis, it can lead to chronic and fatal health conditions.Obstructive Sleep Apnea causes Asthma,Diabetes, Hypertension or Heart Attack. Can Also be indicative of ALZHEIMER’S !


The pain points include:

1) Difficulty in early diagnosis leading to surgical complications.
2) Hectic procedures at the Sleep Labs and most importantly Delayed diagnostic.
3) less availability approx 500 sleep labs.
4) Smoking can increase the amount of inflammation and fluid retention in the upper airway.

## What is OSASense?

```
A Screening solution for Obstructive Sleep Apnea that also helps us to 
monitor the severity of the disease using ML and mobile application.
Prediction of the severity of obstructive sleep apnea by anthropometric features via support vector machine(SVM). 
```

</br>
1) It’s pretty handy to use. The patient clicks on the app.

2) Answers a few simple questions and on the basis of that you get a report whether or not you have sleep apnea.

3) We are using Machine Learning(SVM) algorithm for finding out the AHI(The apnea-hypopnea index), a scale that tells whether or not you have Sleep Apnea and how severe it is.



#### Technical Requirements:

##### Google Collab GPU: Tesla T4 (compute capability: 7.5 ITR/SEC)

##### Dataset of sleep labs: [SLEEP-DATA](https://github.com/akshitagupta15june/OSASense/blob/main/Sleep-lab-Dataset/sleeep_apnea_data.xlsx)

The dataset of Patients information was collected from two independent sleep centres at the Taipei Medical University Hospital (TMUH, Taipei, Taiwan)
and Shuang-Ho Hospital (SHH, New Taipei City, Taiwan).The inclusion criteria for this study were patients referred for suspected sleep disordered breathing, ages between 20 and 80 


##### Sample Image of the dataset

</br>

```
AHI: Apnea hypopnea index we have considered that if AHI is greater than 15 and less than 30
then the person has no sleep apnea but if the AHI is greater than 30 then the person is positive with sleep apnea.
