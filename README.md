## What is OSASense?

A Screening solution for Obstructive Sleep Apnea that also helps us to monitor the severity of the disease using ML and mobile application.
Prediction of the severity of obstructive sleep apnea by anthropometric features via support vector machine(SVM).

It’s pretty handy to use. The patient clicks on the app,
answers a few simple questions and on the basis of that you get a report whether or not you have sleep apnea.

We are using Machine Learning(SVM) algorithm for finding out the AHI(The apnea-hypopnea index), 
a scale that tells whether or not you have Sleep Apnea and how severe it is.
